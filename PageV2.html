    I was attempting to make an exagereted use of the design style called "Contrast" so my work would look crazy and colorfull.</p>
    -Explain colors you dislike or web attributes that annoy you… for Defending of your ” Worst Website in the World”-<br><br> The colors that I dislike tho most on a web page are red and yellow they are just su ugly and bribant that they just annoy me alot, as for web atributes that i dont like att all I would say the one that annoys me the most is "text allign center" if that can be called a web atribute.<br><br> As for the final design of my web site I went for a rare combination of colors that dont go well toguther and I use ugly images and some .gif images to make it look even crazyer. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
